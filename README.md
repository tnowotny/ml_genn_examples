# ml_genn_examples
Example scripts using the ml_genn machine learning framework for SNNs

## latency_mnist_conv
This is a script that was used to tune up a simple example of using convolutions and the eventprop compiler to learn the latency-encoded MNIST dataset. The script offers some diagnostic plots of the learned kernels in the convolutional layer.
